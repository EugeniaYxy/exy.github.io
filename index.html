						<h2>Why it matters</h2>
						<p class="special-size-text"> In 2015, public defenders in Washington State had to take over <b class="special-bold">1000 cases</b> per month. This means that they could only spend <b class="special-bold">36 minutes</b> per case, 
							whereas private attorneys could be given hours or weeks on one case. Unfortunately, 
							<b class="special-bold">the technology available to public defenders are either outdated or don’t properly manage clients on the long term.</b>  
						</p>
						<p class="special-size-text">Not only are public defenders working <b class="special-bold">inefficiently</b> they are being <b class="special-bold">overworked</b>.</p>

							<h2>Here's the case...</h2>
							<h><b class="special-bold">Mary</b> is a public defender working in King County, Washington. Over the past month, her and her legal defense team are helping 
								their client, <b class="special-bold">Harry</b>, manage his most recent case.
							</h>
							<p><li>
								Mary’s heavy caseload makes it difficult to document Harry’s past offenses to make the optimal decision in court to improve Harry’s outcome.
							</li>
							<li>
									<b class="special-bold">John</b>, Mary’s legal assistant, documents all the cases. John only recently started working in this criminal defense firm. 
									He isn’t used to technology in the firm and has trouble understanding criminal defense terminology.
							</li>
							<li>
								Harry has a long legal history, but having gone in and out of homelessness, 
								Harry does not have full awareness of his history.

								<h2>Client Search</h2>
								<p>Shield connects the clients to their past cases. By searching Harry’s full name or by his past offenses, 
									Mary is able to quickly pull the information she needs to help Harry get the best verdict in court.

								<h2>Case Information</h2>
								<p>Shield tracks all past client information and thus missing history with a client can be accounted for by Mary while she works on the case. 
									Shield quickly searches across multiple cases for relevant information, being much quicker than paper and single case documenting systems.

							<div class="inner">
								<h2>New Forms</h2>
								<p>When Mary is swamped with work, John steps in by inputting legal information. Shield forms are designed to mirror legal forms and display questions 
									that are relevant to Harry’s current status. John will be guided by Shield to provide Mary the information she needs quickly and accurately.</p>

								<h2>History Timeline</h2>
								<p>Mary is able to see Harry’s whole history including future events. Mary can react at the appropriate time to get started on Harry’s case again. 
									She’ll also be able to correct any inaccuracies in information whether by fault of Harry, John, or even the court.
