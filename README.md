# Shield 
## Problem Area
In 2015, Washington State Public Defenders were taking over 1000 cases a month and spending an inadequate 36 minutes per case. Current legal processes donâ€™t support the variety of clients defenders must serve, such as the low income populations where permanent residence affects legal information delivery. 

## Capstone Project
_**Shield**_ is a client-case management system that enables public defenders to track client information across multiple cases, in order to minimize human error associated with high case load, time inconsistencies, and case documentation. 
By automating reminders of critical dates and visualizing long-term history, our users can focus on protecting the public interest without getting caught up in tedious workflows.
