## Shield 
### Problem Area
In 2007, about 73% of county public defender offices exceeded the maximum recommended limit of cases. Current legal processes donâ€™t support the variety of clients defenders must serve, such as the low income populations where permanent residence affects legal information delivery. 

### Capstone Project
_**Shield**_ is a client-case management system that enables public defenders to track client information across multiple cases, in order to minimize human error associated with high case load, time inconsistencies, and case documentation. 
By automating reminders of critical dates and visualizing long-term history, our users can focus on protecting the public interest without getting caught up in tedious workflows.
